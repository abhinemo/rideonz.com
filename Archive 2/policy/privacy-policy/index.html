When you apply for or maintain an account with Rideonz, we collect certain personally identifiable

with any specific individual, including IP addresses, usage details and identifying technologies.

We may use, transfer, collect and disclose non­personal information for any purpose. If we do

combine  non­personal  information  with  personal  information,  the  combined  information  will  be

treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.

			<li><b>Cookies : </b>
We use various technologies, including “cookies”, to collect non­identifiable information. A cookie

computer  as  an  anonymous  tag  that  identifies  your  computer  but  not  you.  To  enhance  our

Service,  some  Rideonz  pages  use  cookies,  sent  by  Rideonz  or  its  third  party  vendors,  or  other

technologies.  You  may  control  the  effect  of  cookies  through  your  browser  settings,  however

some features of Rideonz’s Service may not work properly if your use of cookies is disabled.

We  may  also  use  Web  beacon  or  other  technologies,  often  in  conjunction  with  cookies,  to

enhance  our Service  on  a  number  of  pages  of  Rideonz’s  website. A  non­identifiable  notice  of  a

a product or service offered by a third party through Rideonz or sponsored on our site, you consent

to our  sharing  your personal information with those parties. Participation in rewards programs,

discount offers, contests, or other programs that involve third parties, authorizes Rideonz to share

contracts  and  agreements  between  Rideonz  and  the  third  party.  We  only  share  information

reasonably needed to provide additional services, and such shared information may be bound by

parties. We cannot be responsible for these policies.
</li><br/>

We take precautions – including administrative, technical, and physical measures – to safeguard

your personal information against loss, misuse or theft, as well as against destruction, alteration,

disclosure  and  unauthorized  access.  However,  no  security  system  can  be  completely  secure.
